LOOK|AROUND
"THE PATH I'VE BEEN WALKING DOWN LEADS INTO A CAVE SPROUTING FROM THE SIDE OF A SLOPING WALL.  THE CAVE APPEARS TO WIND DOWN UNDERGROUND.  TO MY NORTH, I CAN FEEL THE EYES OF THE WOLF STARING ME DOWN.  MY HEART IS RACING; I CAN'T FIGHT A WOLF.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.
"

NORTH|WOLF|DOG
"FROZEN IN PLACE, I SHAKE MY FEAR ENOUGH TO TAKE A SMALL STEP FOWARD.  THE WOLF WATCHES THIS MOVEMENT, AND GROWLS.
"

SOUTH|FOREST
"THE FOREST TO MY SOUTH IS THICK, TANGLED MESS OF LIFE.
"

EAST|CAVE
"FROM HERE I CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A DIM LIGHT SHINING FROM INSIDE OF THE CAVE.  THIS MIGHT BE MY ONE SHOT AT GETTING TO SAFETY.
"

WEST
"THE PATH WILL TAKE ME BACK TO WHERE I AWOKE IN THE FOREST, BUT IF I TRY TO RUN, THAT WOLF IS GOING TO MAKE ME IT'S DINNER.

"WHERE SHOULD I GO?

"IN A PANIC, I START TO RUN BACK THE PATH, AWAY FROM THE WOLF.  BEHIND ME, I HEAR TWIGS SNAP AND LEAVES SHAKE AS THE BEAST BEGINS TO CHASE ME.  I IMMEDIATELY FEEL AN INTENSE, WARM PRESSURE ON MY ARM, FOLLOWED BY PAIN, AS THE WOLF'S TEETH SINK INTO MY FOREARM.  THE WEIGHT OF THE WOLF ON MY ARM PULLS ME OFF OF MY BALANCE AND I FALL TO THE GROUND.  BEFORE I CAN REACT, THE WOLF IS ON TOP OF ME.  BLOOD LEAKING OUT OF MY ARM, THE WOLF DRAGS ME BY MY NECK OFF OF THE PATH.  AS I FEEL MY LIFE LEAVE MY BODY, ALL I KNOW IS THAT I DON'T WANT TO DIE.  ONE LAST THOUGHT ENTERS MY MIND, AND I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT MY OWN, "YOU WILL NOT REACH THE CITY."

"IN A FIGHT OR FLIGHT MOMENT OF PANIC, I CHARGE STRAIGHT AT THE WOLF.  AT A FULL SPRINT, I START TO YELL.  I IMMEDIATELY FEEL AN INTENSE, WARM PRESSURE ON MY ARM, FOLLOWED BY PAIN, AS THE WOLF'S TEETH SINK INTO MY FOREARM.  THE WEIGHT OF THE WOLF ON MY ARM PULLS ME OFF OF MY BALANCE AND I FALL TO THE GROUND.  BEFORE I CAN REACT, THE WOLF IS ON TOP OF ME.
