"I AM STANDING ON A ROUGHLY TRODDEN PATH IN THE WOODS.  FROM THE COLOR OF THE SKY, THE SUN WILL LIKELY SET SOON.  FIREFLIES ARE HANGING IN THE AIR.  I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW I GOT HERE.  I CAN HEAR HOWLING FORM SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY.

"THERE'S AN OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK LAYING ON THE GROUND.  DARK RED COVER IS CAKED IN DIRT, AND PAGES ARE CLEARLY MISSING.
"THERE'S AN INDENTATION IN THE MUDDY GRASS WHERE THE OLD BOOK WAS PLACED.

NORTH|CLIFF|EDGE
"I WALK UP TO THE CLIFF.  AS I STEP TOWARDS THE DROP, MY STOMACH SINKS.  IN A PANIC I FALL DOWN AND INSTINCTIVELY CRAWL AWAY FROM THE LEDGE.  I WON'T RISK DYING, NOT WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH TO LEARN.
"

EAST|PATH
"THE PATH SLOPES DOWNWARDS.  THE GRASS LOOKS WORN BY HOOFED ANIMALS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNS OF CANINE TRACKS.  THE PATH WINDS THROUGH THE FOREST, SNAKING BETWEEN THE TREES.  I WONDER WHERE IT GOES.
"

SOUTH|WALL|ROCK
"UP THE STEEP SLOPE I CAN BARELY SEE THROUGH THE TREES.  THERE'S SOMETHING GOLDEN, FAR PAST WHERE I WOULD BE ABLE TO CLIMB.  THE SHAPE INDICATES SOME SORT OF ANCIENT TECHNOLOGY THAT SEEMS TO BE FLOATING IN AIR, FAR AWAY.

"THE PAGES OF THE BOOK SEEM TO BE MADE OF AN ODD PLANT.  EVEN IF I COULD READ THE GLYPHS WRITTEN INSIDE, THE BOOK IS SO RIPPED AND DIRTY THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO READ THE GLYPHS EVEN IF I COULD COMPREHEND THEM.
